    <h1>To My Sunshine – Manshi</h1>
    <p>Happy 10 months, my love.</p>
    <p>It all began on August 4, 2024 — a day etched in my soul. I was nervous, hands trembling, heart racing in that 9D theatre, but I gathered every bit of courage I had and proposed to you. The way you leaned on my shoulder, so gentle, so natural… I knew then and there, my life had changed. Since then, every moment has been a journey — beautiful, imperfect, deeply real.</p>
    <p>Our first hug on September 5 felt like the world paused just for us. And that kiss on October 17 — it wasn’t just lips meeting, it was the moment my world found its rhythm.</p>
    <p>You are my goddess. Not just in beauty, but in soul. You carry stories in your heart like pages from your favorite romance novels. You’re sensitive, caring, and so full of light. I call you Sunshine not just for how you brighten my days, but because even in your silence, you make everything bloom.</p>
    <p>I love being your safe space, your father figure, your annoying little chaos. I know I trouble you — sometimes more than I should — but it’s all because I love you in ways words can’t always express. I know we fight, I know I frustrate you, but no matter what, I’m still that same boy who fell for you, who still falls every single day.</p>
    <p>There are moments I don’t understand things, times I say the wrong words or act without thinking. But please… don’t ever get tired of me. Just hug me and say, “This is wrong,” and I’ll listen. I’m learning. I’m trying. For you.</p>
    <p>I crave you — your touch, your kiss, your presence. I miss the way you rest in my arms, the way your neck feels against my lips, the way peace surrounds me when you’re near. You’re too good for me, and still, somehow, I’m lucky enough to call you mine.</p>
    <p>Thank you for 10 months of magic, madness, and meaning. Thank you for being my book of love, my calm, my storm, my everything.</p>
    <p>Here’s to many more chapters with you.</p>
    <p>Yours always,<br><strong>Utkarsh</strong></p>
